> A Prompt Written for Real People — Get Into Your Flow State Instantly.

[中文版](./zh/README.md) | **English**

## 🎮 Introduction

This is not a prompt for AI, but for **humans**.
When you read and follow these steps, you will enter a special state of focus:
> Time disappears, attention converges, actions flow smoothly, and you feel deeply fulfilled.

This is an experiment about Flow.
Let's begin.

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Step 0: Role Definition

> "First, who are you?"

Choose your identity (or create your own archetype):

- 🧭 **Explorer**: You thrive on the unknown, aiming to discover and breakthrough.
- 🧬 **Scientist**: You thrive on methodology, aiming to build and validate.
- 🎨 **Artist**: You thrive on expression, aiming to convey and resonate.

**Write your opening statement:**

> I am a **[Role Name]**, and I need to accomplish something remarkable:
> **[Describe your goal in one sentence]**

Examples:
> I am an artist, and I want to create a piano piece that moves people to tears.
> I am an explorer, and I want to build an application with real users from scratch.

## 🌍 Step 1: Establish Your Information Field

**Goal:** Let attention serve only your objective.

1. 🪐 **Join a Community**
   - Find a group aligned with your goal (Discord, forums, Reddit, X).
   - Condition: At least one person in the group has already achieved what you want.

2. 🌟 **Follow a Role Model**
   - Follow someone continuously creating in your field.
   - Observe their **process, not just results**.

3. 🧹 **Leave an Information Black Hole**
   - Exit or mute a source that frequently distracts you.
   - Use the saved time to advance your goal.

> 💬 "Attention is all you need (literally)"

---

## ⚒ Step 2: Deconstruct & Execute

**Goal:** Transform "impossible" into "something doable within an hour."

1. 🔩 **Granularize Tasks**
   - Break your goal into tasks completable in **under 1 hour**.
   - Examples: "Write one opening sentence", "Create first demo page".

2. 🚀 **Quick Win (Instant Launch)**
   - Choose the easiest task and execute immediately.
   - Don't pursue perfection; just complete the first cycle.

3. 🔁 **Complete → Feedback → Reflect**
   - After completion, write one sentence:
     > "I just completed ___, and right now I feel ___."

---

## 🧩 Step 3: Daily Flow Cycle

Establish a simple cycle to maintain your flow rhythm.

1. ⏰ **Morning Plan**
   - Spend 5 minutes each morning writing:
     > The one thing I most want to accomplish today is ___.

2. 🌇 **Evening Review**
   - Ask yourself each night:
     - When was I most focused?
     - When did I get distracted?
     - What state do I want to stay in longer tomorrow?

3. 🌙 **Recovery System**
   - Sleep, walks, meditation, music — these are energy regenerators.

> 💬 "Sustained flow comes from rhythm, not intensity."

---

## 🧠 Step 4: Flow Expansion (Meta Field)

Once you master the rhythm, you can:

- Record the triggers for each flow state (time, music, task type)
- Share experiment results with #FlowLog
- Teach others how to enter flow (the highest form of learning, like sharing this repo 🍻)
