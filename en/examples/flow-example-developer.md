## 🔁 Daily Cycle
**Morning Plan:** Complete the habit tracking core logic
**Evening Review:** Deep focus from 10am-12pm, lost focus after lunch meetings
**Distractions:** Discord notifications, Reddit programming threads
**State I want to optimize tomorrow:** Block social media until first task is complete

## 🧠 Flow Triggers
- Best music: lofi.cafe, brain.fm focus mode
- Optimal time slot: 9am - 12pm (morning peak)
- Environment: Coffee shop or home office with noise-canceling headphones
- Actions/Rituals: Review yesterday's code, write 3 goals, timer for 90 min blocks

## 💬 Journal
> Day 5: Shipped the first working prototype today. The streak counter took way longer than expected because I kept overengineering it. But once I simplified to just "days in a row," everything clicked. Got into a 3-hour flow state debugging the timezone logic - that feeling when tests all turn green is unmatched. Tomorrow I'll share it in the indie hacker community.
