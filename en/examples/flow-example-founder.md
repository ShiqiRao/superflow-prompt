## 🔁 Daily Cycle
**Morning Plan:** Ship the scheduling feature prototype
**Evening Review:** Most productive during customer calls (9am), energy drops after context-switching
**Distractions:** Twitter doomscrolling, competitor analysis rabbit holes
**State I want to optimize tomorrow:** Batch all calls in morning, deep work in afternoon

## 🧠 Flow Triggers
- Best music: Silence or ambient sounds (coffitivity.com)
- Optimal time slot: 6am - 9am (before the world wakes up)
- Environment: Home office, standing desk, phone in another room
- Actions/Rituals: Morning run, cold shower, review metrics, write "One Thing" for the day

## 💬 Journal
> Week 2: Had 5 customer interviews today and finally found the pattern - everyone struggles with the same scheduling workflow. I was building the wrong feature for a month. Pivoting felt scary but liberating. The flow state came when I stopped trying to build "everything" and focused on solving ONE specific pain point. Prototype done in 4 hours. Launching tomorrow.
